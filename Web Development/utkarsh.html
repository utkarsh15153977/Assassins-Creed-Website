	The Webpage is developed by the help of HTML and CSS.
	We use to make webpages.Besic web pages with the help of HTML and
	we give design and all other stuffs by the help of CSS.
	I will add some peragraphs rendomly from the Intermet.

	uppose a shoe manufacturing company want to show the sale of shoes for five years. For this vast amount of information is to store. So a lot of time and memory will be needed. This method will be tough to understand by a common man. In this situation graphics is a better alternative. Graphics tools are charts and graphs. Using graphs, data can be represented in pictorial form. A picture can be understood easily just with a single look.

Interactive computer graphics work using the concept of two-way communication between computer users. The computer will receive signals from the input device, and the picture is modified accordingly. Picture will be changed quickly when we apply command

Computer graphics is the discipline of generating images with the aid of computers.<br> Today, computer graphics is a core technology in digital photography, film, video games, cell phone and computer displays, and many specialized applications. A great deal of specialized hardware and software has been developed, with the displays of most devices being driven by computer graphics hardware.<br> It is a vast and recently developed area of computer science. The phrase was coined in 1960 by computer graphics researchers Verne Hudson and William Fetter of Boeing. It is often abbreviated as CG, or typically in the context of film as CGI.

Some topics in computer graphics include user interface design, sprite graphics, rendering, ray tracing, geometry processing, computer animation, vector graphics, 3D modeling, shaders, GPU design, implicit surface visualization, image processing, computational photography, scientific visualization, computational geometry and computer vision, among others. The overall methodology depends heavily on the underlying sciences of geometry, optics, physics, and perception.

Computer graphics is responsible for displaying art and image data effectively and meaningfully to the consumer.<br> It is also used for processing image data received from the physical world. Computer graphics development has had a significant impact on many types of media and has revolutionized animation, movies, advertising, video games, and graphic design in general.

	The work described in the present paper represents a
combination of two widely different approaches to the
study of language. The first of these, the automatic generation of sentences by computer, is recent and highly
specialized: Yngve (1962), Sakai and Nagao (1965),
Arsent'eva (1965), Lomkovskaja (1965), Friedman (1967),
and Harper (1967) have applied a sentence generator to the
study of syntactic and semantic problems of the level of
the (isolated) sentence. The second, the study of units
of discourse larger than the sentence, is as old as rhetoric, and extremely broad in scope; it includes, in one way
or another, such diverse fields as beyond--the sentence
analysis (cf. Hendricks, 1967) and the linguistic study of
literary texts (Bailey, 1968, 53--76). The present study
is an application of the technique of sentence generation
to an analysis of the paragraph; the latter is seen as a
unit of discourse composed of lower-level units (sentences),
and characterized by some kind of structure. To repeat:
the object of our investigation is the paragraph; the
technique is analysis by synthesis, i.e. via the automatic
generation of strings of sentences that possess the
properties of paragraphs.

Harper's earlier sentence generation program differed
from other versions in its use of data on lexical cooccurrence and word behavior, both obtained from machine
analysis of written text. These data are incorporated
with some modifications in a new program designed to produce strings of sentences that possess the properties of
coherence and development found in "real" discourse. (The
actual goal is the production of isolated paragraphs, not
an extended discourse.) In essence the program is designed
(i) to generate an initial sentence; (ii) to "inspect"
the result in order to determine strategies for producing
the following sentence; (iii) to build a second sentence,
.making use of one of these strategies, and employing, in
addition, such criteria of cohesion as lexical class
recurrence, substitution, anaphora, an4 synonymy; (iv) to
continue the process for a prescribed number of sentences,
observing both the general strategic principles and the
lexical context. Analysis of the output ~ill lead to
modification of the input materials, and the cycle will be
repeated.<br>
This paper describes the implementations of these
ideas, and discusses the theoretical implications of the
paragraph generator. First we give a description of the
language materials on which the generator operates. The
next section deals with a program which converts the
language data into tables with associative links to minimize 
--3-<br>
the storage requirement and access time. Section 4 describes:
(I) the function of the main components of the generation
program, (2) the generation algorithm. Section 5 desczibes
the implementation of some linguistic assumptions about
semantic and structural connections in a discourse.<br>

	If you want to use random (yet coherent) text as filler content in your Word document, you can use the random content generation formula provided by Word. There are, however, a few notes to make when using this function, depending on how much text you need.

The first method is to simply type in the following formula:
<br>
If you’re feeling a bit more old school, Word can also generate Lorem Ipsum text in the same way. And even if it’s not the tradition you’re after, Lorem Ipsum text has its place. When you use readable English text (like that generated by the rand formula), it can be a distraction if what you want people looking at is the design of a document.

The same rules apply here as the previous method. Type in =Lorem() and then hit Enter, and Word will create five paragraphs of Lorem Ipsum text, each containing three sentences.

Christ, he thinks, by my age I ought to know. You don’t get on by being original. You don’t get on by being bright. You don’t get on by being strong. You get on by being a subtle crook; somehow he thinks that’s what Norris is, and he feels an irrational dislike taking root, and he tries to dismiss it, because he prefers his dislikes rational, but after all, these circumstances are extreme, the cardinal in the mud, the humiliating tussle to get him back in the saddle, the talking, talking on the barge, and worse, the talking, talking on his knees, as if Wolsey’s unravelling, in a great unweaving of scarlet thread that might lead you back into a scarlet labyrinth, with a dying monster at its heart.
