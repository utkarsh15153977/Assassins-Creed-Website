	<h2>What is Assassin's Creed?</h2>
	<hr>
	<p>Assassin's Creed is an action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the first installment in the Assassin's Creed series. The game was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in November 2007 and was made available on Microsoft Windows in April 2008. Also, the game can be played on Xbox One consoles via backward compatibility.	
	<br>
	The plot is set in a fictional history of real-world events and follows the centuries-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight for peace with free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. The game primarily takes place during the Third Crusade in the Holy Land in 1191, with the plot revolving around the Secret Order of Assassins, based upon the Hashshashin sect. The player is, in reality, playing as a modern-day man named Desmond Miles, who, through the use of a machine named the "Animus", is allowed the viewing and controlling of the protagonist's genetic memories of his ancestors, in this case, Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, a member of the Assassins. Through this plot device, details emerge of a struggle between two factions: the Knights Templar and the Assassins, over an artifact known as the "Apple of Eden", an ancient artifact used to control minds.
	<br>
	The game received generally positive reviews, with critics praising its storytelling, visuals, art design, and originality, although the game was also criticized for the repetitive nature of its gameplay. Assassin's Creed won several awards at E3 in 2006, as well as several end-year awards after its release. The game spawned a sequel, Assassin's Creed II, which was released in November 2009. Since the release and success of Assassin's Creed II, subsequent games have been released, with various other Assassins and time periods.

	<hr>
	<p><strong>
	The Assassin's Creed games primarily revolve around the rivalry and conflict between two ancient secret societies — the Assassins (who represent Freedom) and the Knights Templar (who represent Order) — and their indirect relation to an ancient species pre-dating humanity (referred to within the games as "those who came ...

	<strong><h2>The Isu</h2></strong>
	<hr>
	</div>
	<div class="isu-1">
	<strong>
	<p>The Isu are an ancient and highly-advanced species of humanoid beings who were active on Earth during the eponymous era several millennia before the rise of even the most ancient human civilizations. The Isu are responsible for the creation of the Pieces of Eden, powerful artifacts and weapons that augmented their already superhuman abilities, as well as forming the human race itself.
	<br>
	Their history shrouded in mystery, the Isu ruled over Earth roughly 77,000 years ago, before they were largely wiped out, alongside their human creations, during the Great Catastrophe. By that point, the Isu had been in a decade long war with a human rebellion led by two hybrids, Adam and Eve, who sought to free humanity from servitude to their "gods".
	<br>
	ollowing the Great Catastrophe, the Isu population rapidly declined to the point of near extinction within the century, but their legacy would live on for thousands of years through myth and legend, becoming the focal point of many human religions, whether polytheistic or monotheistic. Further still, those Pieces of Eden that survive the Great Catastrophe also influenced early man’s development and eventually became a pivotal desire for both the Templar Order and the Brotherhood of Assassins, who waged a war of their own for control of the Pieces, and by extension humanity’s future.

	<strong><h3>1.Name</h3></strong>
	<strong><p>Due to their long and storied history, and the legacy that their existence left, the Isu,[1][2] as a species, were known by various names to humanity. Classified Homo sapiens divinus by Abstergo Industries, they were also interchangeably referred to as Those Who Came Before,[3] the First Civilization,[4][5] or the Precursors.[6] Beyond this, certain groups of Isu, such as the Capitoline Triad, were believed by most human religions to be a part of a pantheon of gods.

	<div class="isuhistory">
	<strong><h3>2.History</h3>
	<h4>I-Creation Of Humanity</h4>
	<p>lthough the Isu were native to Earth and a product of thousands of years of evolution in their own right, [citation needed] their exact origins are unclear. Minerva, an Isu and member of the Capitoline Triad, simply stated that her kind "came before" humanity and were responsible for the creation of Homo sapiens as a capable and docile workforce, albeit one formed in their own image. [7] Accompanying this, the Isu created Homo neanderthalensis—Neanderthals—whom they designed to be an expeditionary or military force.<br>
	While Minerva openly admitted that the Isu built humanity with the capacity to survive Earth's harsh environments,[4] Juno made it clear that humans were not intended to be "wise", thereby ensuring they were to be obedient and resilient cattle to suit their creator’s needs.<br>
	Extensive research done by Clay Kaczmarek suggests that the Isu had radically altered the genetic makeup of a pre-existing species of primates on the planet to create humanity; as a result, this left a large gap with transitional species between archaic hominids and modern humans. By 1997, the Templars had become aware of this gap in humanity’s evolutionary development and believed that the best way to limit humanity's exposure to the possibility of the existence of the Isu was to arrange for fake skeletons to be planted in an expedition site in Ethiopia, merely to hold accountability for this evolutionary gap.<br>
	In order to enforce their control of humanity, various technologies were created by the Isu; the artifacts that mankind would later name "Pieces of Eden". It is believed that there were certain types of these Pieces that were able to tap simultaneously into a network of neurotransmitters located deep within the human brain, ensuring total obedience through means of remote mind control. However, there were some humans–the hybrids–who had been born without these neurotransmitters, which made them immune to the Pieces' mind control capabilities.<br>
	</p></strong>
	<hr>

	<div class="catastrophe">
	<strong><h3>War and the Great Catastrophe</h3>
	<p>
	While both races survived the Great Catastrophe, few of either species number remained. Working together, they rebuilt their world, and while humanity continued to view their counterparts as gods, they no longer worked in servitude to them. Despite their survival, however, the Isu were unable to fully recover their numbers, and began an inevitable decline toward extinction.
	<br>Having now built a second Eye, Minerva recorded a number of holographic, yet interactive, messages to serve as a warning to those who entered the Vault under what would become the city of Rome. In it, Minerva warned of the impending doom, and spoke of how to prevent it.[4] Concurrently, several other members of the Isu took independent steps to influence the thriving human race, attempting to put their knowledge to stone or parchment, though these did not withstand the test of time.[7]. Barely a hundred years after the creation of the Temples, the Isu were almost completely extinct.<br>
	</p>
	<h4>I.Second Catastrophe</h4>
	<p>
	n 2012, while viewing the genetic memories of his ancestor Ezio Auditore da Firenze, the Assassin Desmond Miles came upon the first of Minerva's recordings.[4] Convinced that they would need Ezio's Apple of Eden to locate the Temples, Desmond continued to relive his ancestor's memories, eventually tracking the artifact down to a vault beneath Santa Maria Aracoeli in Rome.
	<br>
	By October 2012, Desmond and his Assassin team had located the Grand Temple, where they discovered that in order to find the key that unlocked its inner barrier, Desmond would be required to relive the memories of his ancestor Haytham Kenway and his son Ratonhnhaké:ton. After some time in the temple, Shaun Hastings learned that the power sources for the Isu construct were running low and that the team needed to locate more. This prompted Desmond to venture out from the Temple to recover them, and on doing so, Juno showed him visions of the solutions the Isu had attempted as he replaced them.<br>
	After he fully relived the relevant memories of his ancestor, Desmond went forth to unlock the Temple's inner gate, where he found Minerva’s first Eye, which had been repaired by Juno while trapped within the Temple's walls. Juno herself then appeared to the group and told Desmond that by touching it, he would save humanity. She was interrupted by the appearance of Minerva, who had used the second Eye shortly before she died, allowing her a look into the future.<br>
	Minerva's projection warned Desmond that on touching it, the pedestal would indeed protect Earth from the solar flares, but would also release Juno into the world. She reasoned that it was better to let Earth burn than unleash Juno upon it.<br>
	Believing that the choosing to do nothing and let the world burn was worse than releasing Juno, Desmond denied Minerva's plea. He resolved that it was best to save the earth and hope that another might defeat Juno than to let countless lives be lost. Desmond then touched the pedestal and sacrificed himself, unleashing an aurora borealis-like shield around Earth that blocked the worst of the solar flares.<br>
	</p>
	<h4>Post-Second Catastrophe</h4>
	<p>
	Following Desmond's death, Juno uploaded her consciousness from the Grand Temple to the equipment that was brought by Abstergo Industries to inspect the scene and preserve Desmond's body, led by team leader Case Fisher. She then transferred herself to the Abstergo mainframe, while Abstergo worked on using Desmond's genetic material to create a new initiative dubbed the Sample 17 Project, run by Abstergo Entertainment, to further explore his lineage.<br>
	During her natural lifetime, despite one plan to preserve their race resulting in failure, Juno enacted a fail-safe procedure, which allowed her husband Aita to continuously reincarnate in human form. This was enabled through the insertion of 'junk code' in the human genome, which would take over a fetus during development, allowing Aita's return to life. Multiple reincarnations of Aita, colloquially referred to as Sages, were able to exist at the same time, as was the case with Thomas Kavanagh, Jr. and Bartholomew Roberts.<br>
	By 2013, Aita had been reborn in the form of a Sage named John Standish, who worked as an IT technician at Abstergo Entertainment. Once a new research analyst came to work for the company to view the memories of Desmond's ancestor, Edward Kenway, a pirate during the eighteenth century, John sought to use their help in hacking the Abstergo information systems in return for advanced security clearance, while having the analyst pass on Abstergo's files and information to the Assassins Rebecca Crane and Shaun Hastings. It was also through Edward's memories that the analyst would learn of the Sage, Bartholomew Roberts, and his connection to an Isu complex known as the Observatory.<br>
	Despite this façade however, Standish was manipulating the analyst into giving Juno a body to inhabit. When the opportunity finally presented itself though, Juno stated that she was unable to take over the analyst due to the fact that she was scattered too thinly and that there were more artifacts to find and more samples to gather.<br>
	Enraged by his failure, John poisoned the analyst with a low dosage in a vain attempt to allow Juno to inhabit their body successfully, though he was interrupted and killed by Abstergo security personnel, with the analyst eventually recovering from the attack.<br>
	Following Standish's death, Abstergo began examining his remains and discovered his identity as a Sage. Within his genes, they found a high quantity of Isu triple-helix DNA, and began the Phoenix Project in the hope of sequencing the entire Isu genome in order to use the Animus technology and find out the race's scientific secrets, with an emphasis placed on the Pieces of Eden, throughout Isu history.<br>
